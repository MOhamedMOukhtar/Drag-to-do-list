## üìù Description
This project is a **To-Do List App** built with **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React**. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks using a **drag-and-drop interface**.
For state management, I used the Context API, which was a good choice for this project.

**Key features include:**
- **Drag-and-drop functionality** for both columns and tasks using the `dnd-kit` library.
- **Interactive popup windows** for task management using `sweetalert2`.
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback using `react-hot-toast`.
- **Beautiful animations** powered by `animate.css`.
- **Custom icons** from `react-icons` for a polished user interface.
- **Local strage** Tasks are Stored Locally for Easy Access.
